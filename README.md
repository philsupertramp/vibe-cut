# **VibeCut**
## aka **Gemini React Boilerplate**

A simple boilerplate for running single-file React applications generated by LLMs. This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a fast and modern development experience.

## **Getting Started**

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### **Prerequisites**

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)) installed on your machine.

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   git clone https://github.com/philsupertramp/vibe-cut.git  
   cd vibe-cut

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   Using npm:  
   npm install

   Or using yarn:  
   yarn

## **Usage**

1. **Get your React component from an LLM:**  
   Ask your favorite LLM (like me\!) to generate a single-file React application. Make sure the main component is exported as default.  
2. **Replace the placeholder App:**  
   Copy the code from the LLM and paste it into the src/App.jsx file, completely replacing its contents.  
3. **Run the development server:**  
   Using npm:  
   npm run dev

   Or using yarn:  
   yarn dev

4. **View your application:**  
   Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).
